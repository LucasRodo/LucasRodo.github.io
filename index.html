									</header>
									<p>I'm a data scientist jr. and I am also a university student at the 
										Faculty of Economics at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México 
										(UNAM), i am in the fourth semester of my degree.
										<br /><br />
										I am a person with a great curiosity and a great desire to learn, that
										was the reason why I met data science, I chose to study data science 
										through the Python language, and I took two boot camps, the first one was 
										in Python as a language, object-oriented and some libraries; The second 
										was data science, both boot camps I did in English. In the end I liked the
										career of its applications in the real world as its future as a tool.
										<br /><br />
										I am currently looking for a position as a jr data scientist or jr data 
										analyst. To continue what is becoming a passion for handling and studying
										 data, machine learning, deep learning and ways to communicate findings.

											<h3>Stock Market Analysis for Tech Stocks</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											In this project, we'll analyse data from the stock market for some technology stocks.Here are the questions we'll try to answer:
											What was the change in a stock's price over time? What was the daily return average of a stock? What was the moving average of 
											various stocks? What was the correlation between daily returns of different stocks? How much value do we put at risk by investing in 
											a particular stock? How can we attempt to predict future stock behaviour?
